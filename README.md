 ## About The Project

My goal is to create a mowing robot that mows my lawn without any human interaction.

The difference between my mower and any other commercially available mowers is that mine is actually **smart**; it doesn't roam around randomly instead it follows an optimized route, it checks if it's about to rain and acts accordingly, it doesn't need those annoying ugly perimeter cables...
